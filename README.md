# Spokes

Spokes is a website designed to help Mountain Bikers build a community where social interaction is encouraged. Wether that is sharing rides on the website or even creating and sharing a local meet up and ride. Mountain bikers know that you can ride alone, however they all know that riding with friends or even potential friends is what makes the ride even more exciting. 

Spokes hopes to bring that to life. through either the trail sharing page, where riders can share their rides, or through the social hub page where riders can post messages or locations of local rides that people can attend.

## Testing

### Images
* I particualrly found also the sizing of the different particularly a challenge to fit where i wanted them to with in its section, from the main-image to also the users-image.

### About section
* i have done alot of testing to position the three boxes of information, this has provided me with a learning experience of needing to look more into centering, positioning and the bos method. After doing some more html and css research i realised that giving the three different section a class of .row and .column i found that it made the page respon to what i wanted it to do. 

### Trail Section
* I changed the format of the trail section frim just an image and some text into a table to make the page a little more uniform. I am still unsure if that is something that works in the long run however for now it neatens it up.
