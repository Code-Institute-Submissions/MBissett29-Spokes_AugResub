# Spokes

Spokes is a website designed to help Mountain Bikers build a community where social interaction is encouraged. Whether that is sharing trails on the website or even creating and sharing a local meet up and rides through social media links. Mountain bikers know that you can ride alone, however they all know that riding with friends or even a community of like minded people is what makes the ride even more exciting. 

Spokes hopes to bring that to life. through either the trail sharing page, where riders can share their rides. Or through the social networks where riders can post messages or locations of local rides that people can attend.

* __Footer__
    * Decided to keep the footer section short and simple and it shows that spokes is connected to other social media pages. From Instagram to Twitter.
    * The user can click and connect up to the different social media pages to either see photos on instagram either from posts from Spokes or from tags that users have posted on their uploads. Twitter will be used to send out potential rides that maybe local to the user. Depending on location.

## Features to Add

### Image Carousel

* I would like to implement an image carousel on the main image section, using members images. The reason for this not being at the initial launch is due to not having members signed up to the website, but will be updated as members start to join.

### Members Page

* To create a members page I need to create a back end server to store data so that users can become mmembers and add to the website.
* Once logged into the social page it will allow members to input and add their trails to the main trail section part of the website.
